# The following environment variables will need to be set in order to push the
# new speech-to-text Docker image:
#
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: the access key for the speech-to-text user
# - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: the secret key for the speech-to-text user
# - AWS_ECR_DOCKER_REPO: the Elastic Compute Registry URL for the Docker repository
# - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: the AWS region in which the ECR instance lives
# - DEPLOYMENT_ENV: the SDR environment being deployed to (e.g. qa, staging, production)
# - HONEYBADGER_API_KEY: the API key for this project, to support deployment notifications (obtainable from project settings in HB web UI)
#
# The values can be obtained by running `terraform output` in the relevant portion of
# the Terraform configuration.
