WEBVTT

00:17.660 --> 00:19.640
We've done a fantastic job. Well, thank

00:19.640 --> 00:22.100
you. It's just gorgeous. Oh, maybe I'll

00:22.100 --> 00:24.820
look over here and here's another. Yes,

00:24.920 --> 00:26.900
exactly. That's the same kind. That's an

00:26.900 --> 00:28.500
agave. We thought they were Agave

00:28.500 --> 00:30.400
americana, but I had an olive expert out

00:30.400 --> 00:31.720
here looking, and he thinks they're Agave

00:31.720 --> 00:34.960
farrox. And what is the one that was

00:34.960 --> 00:38.140
completely, it's being so carefully held

00:38.140 --> 00:41.900
up? That's my very favorite plant. It's

00:41.900 --> 00:43.420
this one right here, the one that looks

00:43.420 --> 00:45.800
kind of like an upside-down carrot. That's

00:45.800 --> 00:47.620
called a boujum tree. It's named after the

00:47.620 --> 00:51.620
Lewis Carroll poem. Tell me the poem. The

00:51.620 --> 00:53.560
Hunting of the Snark. I don't know. The

00:53.560 --> 00:56.040
boujum. The boujum. Is in there. Okay. So

00:56.040 --> 00:57.920
that's what it's named after. We moved

00:57.920 --> 01:00.020
that here. Remember I was showing you

01:00.020 --> 01:01.700
which ones were original? That's one of

01:01.700 --> 01:03.360
the larger ones we moved. And we actually

01:03.360 --> 01:05.320
got A to Z tree movers in Mountain View to

01:05.320 --> 01:06.560
donate their time, and they went all the

01:06.560 --> 01:08.520
way down to Greenfield, which is south of

01:08.520 --> 01:12.080
Salinas, with a crane. So that's not the

01:12.080 --> 01:15.300
one, but you knew one was there. There was

01:15.300 --> 01:18.260
someone who was selling his house who had

01:18.260 --> 01:20.620
landscaped his entire property in plants

01:20.620 --> 01:22.860
like this, and it was a condition of

01:22.860 --> 01:24.040
escrow that he get rid of them.

01:27.220 --> 01:30.260
That's the normal way it looks? It's quite

01:30.260 --> 01:33.400
lush. They grow on cliffs in Baja, so

01:33.400 --> 01:35.220
usually they look more scraggly and less

01:35.220 --> 01:36.940
branchy. This is a very, very happy

01:36.940 --> 01:39.940
specimen of one. They bloom. They bloom in

01:39.940 --> 01:40.920
the summer. They put out little yellow

01:40.920 --> 01:42.580
flowers at the top. You can sort of see

01:42.580 --> 01:44.540
the remains of the flower stalks. And

01:44.540 --> 01:46.460
since they're Baja native, you know,

01:46.480 --> 01:48.180
they're used to very little water, and

01:48.180 --> 01:50.480
they don't take the combination of cold

01:50.480 --> 01:51.740
and wet. This is one of our really

01:51.740 --> 01:56.100
borderline plants. So we dug a couple feet

01:56.100 --> 01:58.020
down underneath it, amended it with drain

01:58.020 --> 01:59.540
gravel, and then planted it in a raised

01:59.540 --> 02:01.740
bed and built the retaining wall around

02:01.740 --> 02:04.580
it. And we're just hoping that we can keep

02:04.580 --> 02:06.760
it going. And if we get, you know, if this

02:06.760 --> 02:08.100
does turn out to be a really cold wet

02:08.100 --> 02:10.660
winter, that's one of the ones. There's a

02:10.660 --> 02:13.220
couple of quite spectacular plants that we

02:13.220 --> 02:15.300
took that were borderline just because

02:15.300 --> 02:16.440
they would have been bulldozed and gone.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.080
So in choosing these these plants, just so

02:19.080 --> 02:22.340
I can get it clear in my mind. You had the

02:22.340 --> 02:24.440
plan, and so you know the kind of plants

02:24.440 --> 02:26.180
that were here, but you did not try to go

02:26.180 --> 02:29.620
and exactly replace every plant that you

02:29.620 --> 02:30.380
saw. Right, that's an excellent question,

02:30.720 --> 02:33.840
because if you looked at what was here in

02:33.840 --> 02:35.880
the mid-1990s, like I said, there were

02:35.880 --> 02:37.440
like five different kinds and like five

02:37.440 --> 02:38.600
million of each of those. Originally,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.160
there were hundreds of different kinds of

02:40.160 --> 02:41.940
plants and they didn't survive. Now, the

02:41.940 --> 02:43.340
garden had been really neglected since

02:43.340 --> 02:45.460
probably around World War II, too. But

02:45.460 --> 02:47.860
even so, you know, it just, it was

02:47.860 --> 02:49.020
designed as a high maintenance Victorian

02:49.020 --> 02:51.720
garden. And that was not sort of what it

02:51.720 --> 02:53.580
can be now. And there's not the funds to

02:53.580 --> 02:55.800
go out and buy plants. So we take what

02:55.800 --> 02:57.080
we're given, or we took what we're given

02:57.080 --> 02:58.380
for the most part, because we're kind of

02:58.380 --> 03:03.440
full up now. But what they did, before I

03:03.440 --> 03:05.180
came on, they hired a landscape architect

03:05.180 --> 03:07.600
named Nancy Hardesty. Okay. And she came

03:07.600 --> 03:10.340
up with a plan, what she called this ABCD

03:10.340 --> 03:12.440
plan. And it's, So what we do is we

03:12.440 --> 03:15.420
classify plants by type and A plants are

03:15.420 --> 03:18.400
tall focal point plants and each bed gets

03:18.400 --> 03:19.920
one or two of those kind of depending on

03:19.920 --> 03:21.940
the size. So that boujum tree is an A

03:21.940 --> 03:25.120
plant and the palm tree is an A plant. And

03:25.120 --> 03:26.840
then there's B plants which are

03:27.440 --> 03:30.000
substantial plants and large but more

03:30.000 --> 03:32.460
broad. So like when these prickly pear and

03:32.460 --> 03:34.300
the cholla grow up those will be B plants.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.220
And then C plants are are big, you know,

03:38.240 --> 03:40.320
sort of normal-sized plants, like, you

03:40.320 --> 03:41.780
know, kind of that one person can move

03:41.780 --> 03:43.400
around, and that those will, these would

03:43.400 --> 03:45.460
be C plants, and then D plants are ground

03:45.460 --> 03:48.320
cover. And so what every bed is supposed

03:48.320 --> 03:50.260
to have is this pyramidal planting scheme

03:50.740 --> 03:52.960
with an A plant in the middle, B plants

03:52.960 --> 03:55.200
around it, C plants at the edges, and then

03:55.200 --> 03:56.940
D plants doing ground cover in between.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.380
And that's not entirely similar to what

04:00.380 --> 04:02.680
was there. They had hundreds of saguaros

04:02.680 --> 04:04.300
in this original garden. If you look, you

04:04.300 --> 04:06.060
can see just in here all of these. I see.

04:06.060 --> 04:07.460
And there's no, I mean, those are

04:07.460 --> 04:08.980
protected species. There's no way we could

04:08.980 --> 04:10.400
get hundreds of saguaros, and they didn't

04:10.400 --> 04:13.000
survive. So this is the way that we can

04:13.000 --> 04:14.940
get sort of a formal look with a diversity

04:14.940 --> 04:16.980
of plant material to have that sort of

04:16.980 --> 04:18.580
scheme that all the beds have a sort of

04:18.580 --> 04:22.760
uniformity. So, and then in addition to

04:22.760 --> 04:26.740
that, they're trying to put some botanical

04:26.740 --> 04:29.660
usefulness into the garden. So we have a

04:29.660 --> 04:31.460
division into eastern and western

04:31.460 --> 04:34.060
hemispheres. So all plants native to the

04:34.060 --> 04:35.480
western hemisphere, so the Americas

04:35.480 --> 04:37.160
basically, are on this half of the garden,

04:37.260 --> 04:39.540
and all plants native to Asia and Africa

04:39.540 --> 04:41.520
and Europe are on that side of the garden.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.240
Although we did not move any original

04:44.240 --> 04:46.060
plants that were there. So Joshua plants

04:46.060 --> 04:47.660
are native, Joshua trees and yuccas and

04:47.660 --> 04:48.580
things like that are native to the

04:48.580 --> 04:50.040
southwest, so there are yucca trees down

04:50.040 --> 04:52.000
there, and that big prickly pear is an

04:52.000 --> 04:54.380
original, so it didn't get moved. But of

04:54.380 --> 04:55.900
all the new plants that we've put in, so

04:55.900 --> 04:57.220
all the aloes are at that end of the

04:57.220 --> 05:00.880
garden. Oh yeah, that's what's blooming

05:00.880 --> 05:03.740
now, they're looking beautiful. This looks

05:03.740 --> 05:06.800
unique. That's the jumping… Are the

05:06.800 --> 05:08.820
barrels or the jumping cholla? No. And

05:08.820 --> 05:12.420
this one? The one staked up right here?

05:12.480 --> 05:13.700
Yeah. Yeah, that's a jumping cholla.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.060
That's original. I mean, this particular

05:16.060 --> 05:18.400
plant was originally in the garden. This

05:18.400 --> 05:20.940
one is not a descendant of what was here.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.420
The one on the other end, though, is just

05:22.420 --> 05:23.860
a cutting that we took of a plant that had

05:23.860 --> 05:26.840
survived. Do you have any sagurus here?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.520
Yes, we do. Unfortunately, they are under

05:29.520 --> 05:32.080
wraps. Under Rats, yeah. There was a

05:32.080 --> 05:34.160
wonderful person who lived on one of those

05:34.160 --> 05:37.280
hills in Cupertino, a big estate, and they

05:37.280 --> 05:38.700
were selling it and moving to the city to

05:38.700 --> 05:40.480
be closer to their children. The new

05:40.480 --> 05:41.900
owners didn't want the saguaros. They

05:41.900 --> 05:43.780
wanted a basketball court. So now how do

05:43.780 --> 05:45.920
you find these places? They find me. It's

05:45.920 --> 05:48.600
amazing. Yeah. So what would you like that

05:48.600 --> 05:50.140
you don't have that you would love for

05:50.140 --> 05:52.320
someone to call and say? I would love more

05:52.320 --> 05:54.440
saguaros. I would love ground cover at

05:54.440 --> 05:57.040
this point. It's kind of hard to say right

05:57.040 --> 05:58.480
now it depends a lot on the winter.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.160
There's things if we lose I would

06:02.160 --> 06:04.260
definitely like to replace. I do have a

06:04.260 --> 06:05.620
plant list and they're trying to get it up

06:05.620 --> 06:08.040
on the grounds department website of what

06:08.040 --> 06:10.580
we could use. So people just call the

06:10.580 --> 06:13.480
university and say I have this cactus?

06:14.180 --> 06:15.860
Yeah, or people find me. Actually a lot of

06:15.860 --> 06:17.160
our volunteers, the San Francisco

06:17.160 --> 06:18.960
Succulent and Cactus Society was mentioned

06:18.960 --> 06:21.820
in the article and they committed to this

06:21.820 --> 06:24.060
volunteer project to Herb Fong like long

06:24.060 --> 06:25.700
before I was hired, long before any of

06:25.700 --> 06:26.620
this started because because they didn't

06:26.620 --> 06:28.580
want to start the project and then not

06:28.580 --> 06:30.020
have any volunteers and have it kind of

06:30.020 --> 06:33.980
flail. So that's a huge network right

06:33.980 --> 06:36.240
there. So a lot of people who don't know

06:36.240 --> 06:38.700
anything about the garden, but they have a

06:38.700 --> 06:40.360
yard full of plants, they have small

06:40.360 --> 06:43.500
trees. They don't want to kill the plants,

06:43.540 --> 06:44.520
but they don't want to have the plants

06:44.520 --> 06:45.800
anymore, so they call the succulent

06:45.800 --> 06:48.020
societies, and all the succulent societies

06:48.020 --> 06:50.300
pretty much know me now. Well, you have an

06:50.300 --> 06:52.420
article in the State of Greenland. I

06:52.420 --> 06:54.680
talked to Kevin Koltz on my mom's here

06:54.680 --> 06:56.500
list. If you'd like to lobby Kevin Koltz

06:56.500 --> 06:57.960
and put an article in, that would be

06:57.960 --> 07:00.840
great. I think anybody who has a standard

07:00.840 --> 07:04.620
connection would love it. What I really

07:04.620 --> 07:06.620
want, actually what I would really like,

07:06.620 --> 07:08.000
there are definitely plans I would like

07:08.000 --> 07:09.420
people out of the blue to give me, but

07:09.420 --> 07:10.800
what I would really like is people to give

07:10.800 --> 07:12.340
me pictures of the garden from the middle

07:12.340 --> 07:14.960
of this century on. Because I have,

07:15.080 --> 07:16.460
like... I think it's that they don't have

07:16.460 --> 07:18.060
a lot of art in it, because they have many

07:18.060 --> 07:19.340
other, you know, the rest of it. I mean,

07:19.400 --> 07:22.640
even if they just put a note about having

07:22.640 --> 07:25.540
a baby. So if you do know people, feel

07:25.540 --> 07:28.720
free to drop it. Darn. Feel free to drop

07:28.720 --> 07:31.020
it. Just give them the evidence that you

07:31.020 --> 07:36.420
know. Yeah. Yeah. Well, my other problem

07:36.420 --> 07:38.400
is, I went to her farm, my Boston grounds,

07:38.580 --> 07:40.740
and I'm like, you know, okay, I can work

07:40.740 --> 07:43.260
tonight. I can get people to do all that.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.400
But I'm trying to think about cacti. I

07:45.400 --> 07:47.660
know like California native plants, like

07:47.660 --> 07:49.860
heirloom vegetables. I was like, that's

07:49.860 --> 07:53.580
okay. It's okay. Very quickly, very, very,

07:53.600 --> 07:54.200
very quickly.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.260
Thank you for coming!

08:05.340 --> 08:07.100
Well, it's really our volunteers.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.580
Thanks for coming by. Bye.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.700
I was going to do an interview, but you

08:48.700 --> 08:50.360
told me everything I needed to know. Oh,

08:50.400 --> 08:52.000
come on. Surely you can think of something

08:52.000 --> 08:55.860
else to ask. People find you. Don't look.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.500
Yeah. Look over here. Look at the plant.

08:58.640 --> 09:03.220
Yeah. This is truly a work of love on your

09:03.220 --> 09:06.140
part, right? Absolutely. I mean, this

09:06.140 --> 09:08.680
garden is a very special place. And all of

09:08.680 --> 09:10.120
the volunteers who put so much of their

09:10.120 --> 09:12.520
effort into it, I mean, it's just a

09:12.520 --> 09:16.340
wonderful, wonderful effort. And how much

09:16.340 --> 09:18.260
time a week do you put into this place?

09:18.460 --> 09:20.120
I'm employed in the Grants Department 20

09:20.120 --> 09:22.160
hours a week, so, you know, occasionally

09:22.160 --> 09:24.060
there's a few extra hours here and there.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.440
But pretty much it's a half-time

09:25.440 --> 09:27.180
commitment, and then I have my other half

09:27.180 --> 09:29.240
-time job in archives. So I have more than

09:29.240 --> 09:30.840
enough to keep me busy. Okay, what makes

09:30.840 --> 09:33.120
this place so special? Well, there's not

09:33.120 --> 09:35.440
very many 19th century gardens left on the

09:35.440 --> 09:37.960
peninsula to begin with. And then this

09:37.960 --> 09:40.160
garden itself is one of the earliest

09:40.160 --> 09:43.180
experiments with growing these kind of

09:43.180 --> 09:45.300
plants, cacti and succulents outdoors not

09:45.300 --> 09:47.840
under glass that was one of the great

09:47.840 --> 09:49.840
innovations that the landscape architect

09:49.840 --> 09:51.400
who designed this garden Rudolph Ulrich

09:51.400 --> 09:55.100
made so in a certain way you can think of

09:55.100 --> 09:57.180
it as like the very very earliest

09:57.180 --> 09:58.840
beginnings of xerophytic gardening in

09:58.840 --> 10:00.460
California that you know now we have all

10:00.460 --> 10:02.040
these drought tolerant gardens and this is

10:02.040 --> 10:04.540
one of the places it all started. Wow.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.260
Pretty cool. It is pretty cool and these

10:08.260 --> 10:10.020
plants do they have Do they have

10:10.020 --> 10:13.360
personalities for you? Not so much for me,

10:13.400 --> 10:15.220
except the prickly pears always seem to be

10:15.220 --> 10:16.500
trying to jump me and get a couple of

10:16.500 --> 10:18.680
spines in me. But I know a lot of my

10:18.680 --> 10:20.880
volunteers have particular affinities with

10:20.880 --> 10:22.260
particular kinds of plants, and they're

10:22.260 --> 10:24.320
always, oh yes, she's happy today, oh he

10:24.320 --> 10:26.800
doesn't look too good. So I think they do

10:26.800 --> 10:29.560
have personalities. You were talking a

10:29.560 --> 10:33.200
little bit before about the levels,

10:33.340 --> 10:35.460
there's four levels. Tell me a little bit

10:35.460 --> 10:38.120
about that. Okay, Nancy Hardesty, the

10:38.120 --> 10:39.640
landscape architect who helped come up

10:39.640 --> 10:41.680
with this restoration schema, it's a way

10:41.680 --> 10:44.660
that we can use donated plants and take

10:44.660 --> 10:46.940
what plant materials are given to us and

10:46.940 --> 10:48.540
yet maintain some sort of visual

10:48.540 --> 10:52.080
uniformity and Victorian formalism in the

10:52.080 --> 10:53.420
garden. This was originally a formal

10:53.420 --> 10:55.920
garden. It's not, you know, a naturalistic

10:55.920 --> 10:57.800
run wild kind of garden, so there's a lot

10:57.800 --> 11:01.180
of symmetry, a lot of balance. So what she

11:01.180 --> 11:03.600
did was create four general categories of

11:03.600 --> 11:05.380
plants. There's A-type plants, which are

11:05.380 --> 11:07.980
really tall, big, massive plants when

11:07.980 --> 11:10.200
they're mature. They're the focal point of

11:10.200 --> 11:12.140
every bed, and there's 50-some-odd beds in

11:12.140 --> 11:13.800
the garden. So every bed, depending on

11:13.800 --> 11:15.880
size, should have one or two plants. And

11:15.880 --> 11:17.420
an example of that would be this palm tree

11:17.420 --> 11:19.560
or this Yucca Follifera here. They're just

11:19.560 --> 11:22.480
commanding plants. And then there's B-type

11:22.480 --> 11:24.660
plants, which are also large plants, but

11:24.660 --> 11:27.000
they're bulkier and not as tall. So those

11:27.000 --> 11:28.700
would ring the outside of the A-type

11:28.700 --> 11:30.260
plants. And then there's C-type plants,

11:30.420 --> 11:31.780
which are, you know, a couple feet in

11:31.780 --> 11:34.000
diameter maximum. maximum. Those go

11:34.000 --> 11:36.520
outside the bee plants. And then D-type

11:36.520 --> 11:38.120
plants are ground cover and those go

11:38.120 --> 11:40.000
around the edges of all the beds. So that

11:40.000 --> 11:41.620
allows us to have a pyramidal planting

11:42.040 --> 11:44.220
plan for every bed, but it doesn't

11:44.220 --> 11:45.560
constrain us with the type of plants

11:45.560 --> 11:47.120
because we are so dependent on donated

11:47.120 --> 11:49.860
plants. So it's worked really well. Tell

11:49.860 --> 11:51.840
me your name and spell it so I don't waltz

11:51.840 --> 11:54.460
it up. It's Christy. It's Christy Smith, C

11:54.460 --> 11:57.340
-H-R-I-S-T-Y, and the last name is Smith,

11:57.460 --> 12:00.980
S-M-I-T-H. And give me a title. volunteer

12:00.980 --> 12:02.720
coordinator Stanford Arizona Garden

12:02.720 --> 12:06.540
Project great now the palm trees in a

12:06.540 --> 12:11.640
plant right okay that's an a plant okay

12:11.640 --> 12:17.640
give me a B plant oh and these are sea

12:17.640 --> 12:21.980
plants oh good I love them oh they're

12:21.980 --> 12:24.620
beautiful and where's the D plant

12:30.640 --> 12:32.180
Professor Dudley who was a botanist here

12:32.180 --> 12:34.880
in the 20s and 20s. Really? Yep. So I'm

12:34.880 --> 12:35.860
working on a little Dudley Memorial

12:35.860 --> 12:38.500
Garden. Now what I'd like to do... Do you

12:38.500 --> 12:40.600
want to see the agave? Yeah, I don't want

12:40.600 --> 12:41.800
to... The aloe polyphyllo, that's the one

12:41.800 --> 12:43.180
you probably want to still. Yeah, that's

12:43.180 --> 12:44.480
the hot one. And you're going to have to

12:44.480 --> 12:45.860
climb in the plants to see it. That's

12:45.860 --> 12:48.240
right. I'm going to let you walk ahead of

12:48.240 --> 12:49.800
me. Alright, I'll put the doggy here.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.780
That's okay. Sit. Sit. Stay.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.420
And just talk to me about this. Alright,

13:00.540 --> 13:02.600
this is an aloe polyphylla. It's called a

13:02.600 --> 13:04.320
spiral aloe. They've only come into

13:04.320 --> 13:06.840
cultivation recently. As you can see, it's

13:06.840 --> 13:10.920
very geometric. And this one spirals to

13:10.920 --> 13:12.760
the right and they come spiraling both

13:12.760 --> 13:14.160
ways. There's one that spiraled to the

13:14.160 --> 13:16.700
left as well. And I would dearly love to

13:16.700 --> 13:18.060
get another one that spirals the other way

13:18.060 --> 13:20.900
for the garden. Tell me a little bit about

13:20.900 --> 13:23.540
this plant. This particular one? It's an

13:23.540 --> 13:26.060
aloe polyphylla. It's a spiral aloe. They

13:26.060 --> 13:28.600
come spiraled both ways. This is a right

13:28.600 --> 13:30.300
spiraled one, but there are left spiraled

13:30.300 --> 13:32.320
ones as well, which I would love to get

13:32.320 --> 13:34.900
another one for the garden. And they've

13:34.900 --> 13:36.360
only fairly recently been brought into

13:36.360 --> 13:37.820
cultivation. They're fascinating to look

13:37.820 --> 13:39.920
at because they are so geometric in their

13:39.920 --> 13:42.200
form. And once they get established, you

13:42.200 --> 13:44.360
know, this will maybe triple in size and

13:44.360 --> 13:46.040
then it makes offsets. So it'll actually,

13:46.600 --> 13:48.280
the spiral will split. It's kind of like

13:48.280 --> 13:49.540
watching a cell divide and there will

13:49.540 --> 13:51.360
become two spirals and out of it when it

13:51.360 --> 13:53.560
gets, you know, about that size. This is

13:53.560 --> 13:55.260
the hot plant. This is one everybody wants

13:55.260 --> 13:57.400
to see, right? Well, a lot of people want

13:57.400 --> 14:00.500
to see it. They're not that common yet. So

14:00.500 --> 14:05.080
I think it's just a spectacular plant. No,

14:05.080 --> 14:09.400
it's just still. Yeah. Take a look. You

14:09.400 --> 14:12.020
can see it. Oh. Oh, yeah, that looks

14:12.020 --> 14:14.940
great. I got my little tweezers. I should

14:14.940 --> 14:15.660
be cleaning it out.

14:27.380 --> 14:32.800
Here's a nice red stem. And it's in the

14:32.800 --> 14:34.620
wrong place in the bed. That's okay, we

14:34.620 --> 14:35.100
won't...

14:38.280 --> 14:41.660
And are the swirls new? Um, they've been

14:41.660 --> 14:41.900
in the...

14:51.600 --> 14:53.560
I suppose one other thing to think about

14:53.560 --> 14:55.440
is the original pattern of them although

14:55.440 --> 14:59.300
we've had to dig them out from up to 12

14:59.300 --> 15:02.900
inches of dirt oh hang on a second now you

15:02.900 --> 15:06.140
can talk to me over here oh thank god tell

15:06.140 --> 15:08.160
me about the rocks the rocks are one of

15:08.160 --> 15:10.500
the really interesting historic features

15:10.500 --> 15:13.580
of the garden they're original. I mean

15:13.580 --> 15:15.760
there's not that much that's, you know,

15:15.760 --> 15:18.280
left from when the garden was actually

15:18.280 --> 15:19.960
made, but the bed outline is all original.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.260
The rocks were buried under up to 12

15:22.260 --> 15:23.960
inches of dirt and we've hand excavated

15:23.960 --> 15:25.520
and raised them and preserved the pattern.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.600
So that really is, you know, the plants

15:27.600 --> 15:28.900
may be slightly different than what you

15:28.900 --> 15:30.040
would have seen in the original garden,

15:30.160 --> 15:31.720
but the bed outline and sort of the

15:31.720 --> 15:33.520
quadrilateral symmetry of the garden is

15:33.520 --> 15:35.380
original and as close to the original as

15:35.380 --> 15:37.380
we can make it as we excavate it. This

15:37.380 --> 15:40.420
place has real meaning as part of

15:40.420 --> 15:42.560
Stanford, doesn't it? Yeah. Talk to me

15:42.560 --> 15:45.920
about that. This garden was originally

15:45.920 --> 15:47.180
going to be the backyard for the

15:47.180 --> 15:49.080
Stanford's house that was going to be

15:49.080 --> 15:50.900
where the mausoleum now stands, and it was

15:50.900 --> 15:53.440
built in the early 1880s before they had

15:53.440 --> 15:54.900
started construction on the house and

15:54.900 --> 15:57.240
before little Leland died. And as you

15:57.240 --> 15:59.080
know, construction on the house was put

15:59.080 --> 16:01.240
aside when he passed away and they decided

16:01.240 --> 16:03.120
to found a university. But the garden had

16:03.120 --> 16:07.760
already been made. So it was a garden

16:07.760 --> 16:10.360
designed for a residence. Rudolf Ulrich,

16:10.460 --> 16:11.860
who designed this garden, also designed a

16:11.860 --> 16:13.160
garden at the Hotel Del Monte for

16:13.160 --> 16:14.680
Stanford's business partner, Charles

16:14.680 --> 16:16.940
Crocker. And it's very similar in certain

16:16.940 --> 16:19.540
ways, but it's also more open and more

16:19.540 --> 16:21.580
formal because it was a public garden to

16:21.580 --> 16:23.340
go with a hotel, and this was a private

16:23.340 --> 16:26.260
garden. But yeah, it's a real early piece

16:26.260 --> 16:27.640
of Stanford history. There's not too many

16:27.640 --> 16:29.520
pieces of early Stanford history left that

16:29.520 --> 16:31.500
you can just walk through. Imagine what it

16:31.500 --> 16:32.760
would be like. So I think it is a very

16:32.760 --> 16:35.760
special place. What's the, what's the,

16:35.780 --> 16:38.100
tell me about the upside down carrot. Oh,

16:38.140 --> 16:40.220
that's my very favorite tree. That's a

16:40.220 --> 16:42.980
Bujum tree. It's over there. It's named

16:42.980 --> 16:44.780
after the Lewis Carroll poem by whoever, I

16:44.780 --> 16:46.000
don't know who discovered it, but it's

16:46.000 --> 16:47.660
native to Baja, California, and obviously

16:47.660 --> 16:50.720
they were a Lewis Carroll fan. I think I

16:50.720 --> 16:52.340
really like it because in addition to it

16:52.340 --> 16:54.220
looking beautiful and unique, it's the

16:54.220 --> 16:56.060
first large plant that I helped move into

16:56.060 --> 16:57.900
the garden. I didn't really know you could

16:57.900 --> 16:59.300
move plants that big and have them

16:59.300 --> 17:02.020
survive. and the tree crew guys that

17:02.020 --> 17:03.640
helped me move it didn't know that either

17:03.640 --> 17:05.080
because they move oak trees they don't

17:05.080 --> 17:07.520
move succulent trunked cacti so so we had

17:07.520 --> 17:09.700
to prune back all the branches we wadded

17:09.700 --> 17:11.040
up newspaper and stuffed them all between

17:11.040 --> 17:12.880
the branches then we wrapped it in in old

17:12.880 --> 17:14.200
sheets and then we build a framework of

17:14.200 --> 17:15.640
two by fours around it before we let the

17:15.640 --> 17:17.480
crane lift it up and then the guys

17:17.480 --> 17:19.140
excavated the root ball and bald and

17:19.140 --> 17:20.580
burlap tit and we brought it here and put

17:20.580 --> 17:22.400
it into place with a crane and it grew it

17:22.400 --> 17:24.740
was so exciting so I'm very very attached

17:24.740 --> 17:27.660
to that particular plant. It's like a

17:27.660 --> 17:30.260
child for you. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah

17:30.260 --> 17:33.960
probably. And who is this person? Who's

17:33.960 --> 17:35.920
this guy? Hey Uzo, can you say hello? This

17:35.920 --> 17:37.880
is my little garden mascot. Yes, she helps

17:37.880 --> 17:39.800
us keep the ground squirrels away. We have

17:39.800 --> 17:41.100
a lot of ground squirrel damage in the

17:41.100 --> 17:43.560
garden. But she comes out and keeps me

17:43.560 --> 17:47.340
company too. Yeah, she's a sweetheart. Hi

17:47.340 --> 17:50.140
Lisa, how you doing? She says Uzo, my name

17:50.140 --> 17:50.520
is Uzo.

17:53.460 --> 17:56.400
Yeah, that's a cute puppy. Cute puppy dog.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.980
She says that she just loves the fact that

17:59.980 --> 18:04.580
I have this job. Oh, I bet she does. Now I

18:04.580 --> 18:06.240
gotta take a picture of the carrot. Yeah.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.220
One of my volunteers is coming down here

18:11.220 --> 18:13.460
with a large format negative camera and

18:13.460 --> 18:14.320
taking pictures of it.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.060
Come here,πάotra

18:50.440 --> 18:51.900
I'm going to go make a couple of...

18:51.900 --> 18:53.900
They're very vicious. Are they? Yes.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.440
Detriment. They're small and they break

18:56.440 --> 18:58.720
off and they're very sharp and you get

18:58.720 --> 19:00.080
them in your skin and you can't see them

19:00.080 --> 19:03.300
to get them out and they can get infected

19:03.300 --> 19:05.920
and painful. What do they call? The little

19:05.920 --> 19:10.120
fuzzy things are called blockets. And so

19:10.120 --> 19:11.840
they look beautiful. They look friendly.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.500
they don't look very spiky at all but

19:13.500 --> 19:18.160
they're bad news. Watch out. If you look

19:18.160 --> 19:20.100
at this one over here this is another kind

19:20.100 --> 19:21.980
of prickly pear and you can see this has

19:21.980 --> 19:23.620
the combination of spines and glochids.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.160
Which one is that? The purple one over

19:25.160 --> 19:27.700
here. Yeah this one only has the glochids.

19:27.820 --> 19:29.440
This one has the combination of both. So

19:29.440 --> 19:31.360
that genus comes with a whole range from

19:31.360 --> 19:33.720
like lots of spines and few glochids to

19:33.720 --> 19:35.120
all glochids and no spines.

19:39.020 --> 19:41.020
But these are more obvious that you

19:41.020 --> 19:43.360
shouldn't touch them. Let's see what that

19:43.360 --> 19:43.960
one's going to do.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.520
That's pretty awesome. Which means that I

20:02.520 --> 20:05.400
get nice clean shots. I'm already consumed

20:05.400 --> 20:07.840
with envy for your camera stuff. I'm

20:07.840 --> 20:07.980
sorry.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.880
And I guess one of the other really

20:24.880 --> 20:26.420
special things about this garden is that

20:26.420 --> 20:27.840
there's almost always something in bloom.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.340
Hang on one second. Start up. Okay. One of

20:30.340 --> 20:31.660
the other really great things about this

20:31.660 --> 20:33.200
garden is that there's always something in

20:33.200 --> 20:34.820
bloom year round. So even now that it's

20:34.820 --> 20:36.360
the middle of January, we've got aloes

20:36.360 --> 20:38.660
blooming, and this giant agave here is

20:38.660 --> 20:41.080
starting to think about blooming. So it's

20:41.080 --> 20:42.800
sending up its big flower spike, and it'll

20:42.800 --> 20:44.320
bloom sometime over the next couple months

20:44.320 --> 20:46.420
and set seed and produce some offsets, and

20:46.420 --> 20:48.380
it will die. But it will leave plenty of

20:48.380 --> 20:51.040
babies behind it. So it's pretty

20:51.040 --> 20:52.420
spectacular to watch the things in bloom,

20:52.520 --> 20:54.840
even in the middle of winter. Now, the

20:54.840 --> 20:55.420
giant...

20:59.480 --> 21:01.180
Now, I'm going to shoot the carrot before

21:01.180 --> 21:01.860
I forget it.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.520
It's a lovely place. If you want ideas on

22:27.520 --> 22:29.880
your scale of flexibility. It's just

22:29.880 --> 22:32.280
wonderful. Yeah, and Nancy earned every

22:32.280 --> 22:33.020
bit that we paid.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.500
Yeah, that big one is really big. Lovely.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.760
Now these rocks are all original, right?

22:53.480 --> 22:56.120
Well, the ones that look really older...

22:56.120 --> 22:59.980
...and Morgan Hill. It's just great.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.600
Do you know anything about cactus? A

23:44.600 --> 23:46.280
little bit. You need to know anything

23:46.280 --> 23:48.540
about cactus? Go ahead. I was just always

23:48.540 --> 23:50.360
wondering, they tend to grow that white

23:50.360 --> 23:51.740
stuff that's on that one. Go ahead.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.280
That's, um... Walk over here. I'm holding

23:54.280 --> 23:56.920
it. Isn't that some poison? No, it's just

23:56.920 --> 24:00.940
a white fluff that they make. And certain

24:00.940 --> 24:03.880
species of cactus have it. It's usually in

24:03.880 --> 24:05.980
the genus Oreosurius and they're called

24:05.980 --> 24:08.100
old man cacti. They just put out, that's

24:08.100 --> 24:09.580
one of the sort of protective things they

24:09.580 --> 24:10.700
have. It gives them a little protection

24:10.700 --> 24:12.740
from hot sun and probably a little frost

24:12.740 --> 24:15.280
protection as well. It's not strychnine?

24:16.520 --> 24:19.740
No, it's not strychnine. Because there was

24:19.740 --> 24:22.460
this, you guys used to have cactuses

24:22.460 --> 24:23.960
stacked around over there waiting for you

24:23.960 --> 24:26.040
to plant it or whatever. Uh huh. And it

24:26.040 --> 24:27.680
was during the summertime and it was

24:27.680 --> 24:31.600
covered with that white stuff. Well

24:31.600 --> 24:33.000
there's other kinds of white stuff.

24:33.140 --> 24:35.760
There's an infestation called like cotton

24:35.760 --> 24:40.180
stain. Cotton stain. Cotton stain. Cotton

24:40.180 --> 24:45.880
stain. Uh huh. Cotton stain. Cotton stain.

24:47.020 --> 24:51.380
Uh huh, interesting. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

24:58.940 --> 25:01.380
Oh well, you know, you never know what

25:01.380 --> 25:02.620
these stories will do. You might agree

25:02.620 --> 25:05.400
that's what people do in the practice. But

25:05.400 --> 25:07.700
they're just pieces of plant material.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.480
They're not people who talk about anything

25:10.480 --> 25:11.020
about it.

25:18.420 --> 25:21.540
I couldn't say. Goodbye.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.040
Sorry? That's a baby soil. That's what

25:53.040 --> 25:53.420
they look like.

25:56.560 --> 26:02.380
I hear they

26:02.380 --> 26:03.700
grow something like an inch a year.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.200
I'm sorry.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.040
Working away. There's nothing like getting

29:54.040 --> 29:55.740
muddy and dirty in the pursuit of your

29:55.740 --> 29:56.020
job.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.720
They have to be thinned out anyway,

30:09.940 --> 30:12.380
because otherwise they'll just totally

30:12.380 --> 30:15.180
grow over each other and get crowded out.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.420
As much easier to do when the dirt is

30:33.420 --> 30:34.220
soft. Yes

31:10.540 --> 31:12.100
I'm going to go find some more cerns.

31:12.100 --> 31:12.420
Okay.

31:18.420 --> 31:20.360
So this is how you propagate cern cactus,

31:20.620 --> 31:23.200
but hopefully nobody will get ideas and

31:23.200 --> 31:24.580
come in here and start taking things. We

31:24.580 --> 31:26.120
do have occasional problems with that.

31:38.380 --> 31:40.320
The great thing about these is they have

31:40.320 --> 31:42.620
to harden off, so they have to callus over

31:42.620 --> 31:44.100
before you plant them in the ground, so

31:44.100 --> 31:45.400
you can leave them sitting around for a

31:45.400 --> 31:46.700
couple of weeks before you plant them.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.660
Okay, now I'm going to just let you work

31:48.660 --> 31:49.340
and... in.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.000
All right.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.000
Alright, should we go paint some more?
